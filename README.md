## Project Summary
### Bootstrap Demo
- Created a responsive web page using Bootstrap 5.
- Features a Navbar, two-column grid layout, styled button, and an alert.

### Tailwind CSS Demo
- Built a card-style responsive layout using Tailwind utility classes.
- Includes an image, headline, descriptive text, and a call-to-action button.

### React.js Demo
- Developed a simple interactive React component.
- Displays a welcome message with a name passed via `props`.
- Includes a button that toggles a message using React's `useState()`.

## Experience
- This lab introduced a hands-on comparison between Bootstrap’s component-based system and Tailwind’s utility-first approach.
- Learned to manage component state in React and appreciated its declarative UI rendering.

## Submission
- GitHub repo with `bootstrap-demo/`, `tailwind-demo/`, `react-demo/`, and `README.md`
- Video walkthrough submitted via Google Classroom.
